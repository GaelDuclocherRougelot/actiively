# Actiively

Actiively is a centralized activity search platform

## Problematic

You want to find an activity, but you are lost, you do not know on which website you will be able to find the activity of your dreams. because there is no centralized platform and it can be long to find, this is where Actiively comes in.

## Solution

The goal is to facilitate the search for an activity or organization.
With the search and filter system, you can easily and quickly find an activity that suits you and highlight organizations that need visibility.
